<p>As part of our fellowship with Measurement Canada, we are constantly looking for opportunities to work with our partners to build digital capacity within the organization. Thank you to everyone who joined us for our first Lunch and Learn (L&L); we were thrilled to learn that we had over 60 participants! For those that were unable to join and wanted to, you can find the presentation slide <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/codefor.ca/file/d/1uVkPuhOwiWUy1YR1BIUt2zhBIdImeaky/view?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>

<p>As a recap, we talked about two key things:</p>

<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>What is Design Thinking?</li>
  <li>What is Agile and how can it be applied?</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is Design Thinking?</h2>
<p>Design Thinking is a creative problem solving technique with the user at the centre.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">"You have to start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology - not the other way around. - Steve Jobs"</blockquote>

<p>Design Thinking challenges us to start with understanding and empathizing with the end user’s pain points. By understanding the users needs and wants, Apple was able to re-imagine and create products that set itself apart from its competitors. During our stay at MC, we will also be using this methodology to help us create an impactful digital solution for our end users.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is Agile and how can it be applied?</h2>
<p>From our conversations with various individuals, we discovered that there was an interest to learn what was Agile and how it could be applied. While the standard definition would involve the words “iterative, continuous delivery”, we decided that it wouldn’t be very applicable to our audience and would miss the point that Agile is a mindset. After considering our audience group, we explained Agile as:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote" style="text-align:center;">“A specific set of values/principles that the team agrees to uphold in pursuit of something.”</blockquote>

<p> We suggested three things to our partners that they could do to be more agile:</p>
<ol class="pg-list">
  <li>Work in pods</li>
  	<ol type="a">
    	<li>Start by identifying the group of people you work with on a daily basis</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Operate in sprints</li>
    <ol type="a">
    	<li>Identify the batch of things that need to be done within the next 2 weeks with your pod</li>
        <li>Focus as much as possible doing only what has been allocated in the sprint</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Adopt daily standup as part of your routine</li>
  	<ol type="a">
        <li>Great way to stay up to date as to what is happening around you</li>
        <li>It can be as informal as coffee chats</li>
        <li>Great for accountability!</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
